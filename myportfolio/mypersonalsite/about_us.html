<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<p>
Before diving into the details of creating Web pages with HTML5 and CSS, it is useful to look at how these technologies relate to the development of the Internet and the World Wide Web. The Internet began with the connection of computers and computer networks. This connectivity has had a huge impact on our daily lives. Today, millions of people worldwide have access to the Internet, the world’s largest network. Billions of Web pages, providing information on any subject you can imagine, are currently available on the World Wide Web. People use the Internet to search for information, to communicate with others around the world, and to seek entertainment. Students register for classes, pay tuition, and find out final grades via this computer network. Stores and individuals sell their products using computer connectivity, and most industries rely on the Internet and the World Wide Web for business transactions. 

Many people use the terms “Internet” and “World Wide Web” interchangeably, but that is not accurate. The Internet is the infrastructure, the physical networks of computers. The World Wide Web, also called the Web, is the part of the Internet that supports multimedia and consists of a collection of linked documents. To support multimedia, the Web relies on the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is a set of rules for exchanging text, graphic, sound, video, and other multimedia files. The linked documents, or pages of information, on the Web are known as Web pages. Because the Web supports text, graphics, sound, and video, a Web page can include any of these multimedia elements. The Web is ever-changing and consists of billions of Web pages. Because of the ease of creating Web pages, more are being added all the time.
